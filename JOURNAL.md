## 2026-05-08 — Mac Agent Becomes a LaunchAgent

### What Happened

The Mac consumer can now run permanently as a per-user macOS LaunchAgent. The docs now lead users through the happy path: run once in the foreground for Messages automation permission, install with `mac/launchd/install.sh`, verify with `launchctl`, and check logs when something feels off.

### Why

A bridge that only works while a terminal window is open is fragile. launchd gives users auto-start and auto-restart without exposing the Mac to the internet or adding secrets.

### Trade-offs

We chose a templated plist plus installer over hand-editing paths, `launchctl bootstrap` over deprecated `load`, plist environment variables over a wrapper script, `ThrottleInterval=60` to tame crash loops, and split logs so early startup failures are visible.

### Impact

Users get a calmer setup story and a daemon that survives login, restarts, and routine upgrades.

## 2026-05-08 — Project Bootstrapped

**Squad:** The Default Squad · **Vibe:** friendly · **Theme:** Community Builders

### The Team

Architect, Coder, Tester, DevRel, Prompter, GitOps, Evaluator, Researcher, Scribe

### What Happened

Project initialized with the **The Default Squad** squad preset via `npx snap-squad init`. The full `.squad/` directory, hook chain (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, copilot-instructions.md), and this journal were generated automatically.

### Steering Moment

The builder chose **default** — default generalist squad — reliable, well-rounded, good for any project. This shapes everything that follows: who reviews code, how decisions get made, what gets tested first.

### What's Next

- [ ] First real feature or task
- [ ] Builder configures project context in `.squad/team.md`
- [ ] First decision logged to `.squad/decisions.md`

## How to Use This Journal

> *Scribe's guide for the builder and future contributors.*

This isn't a changelog. It's the **story of how the project was built** — the decisions, the pivots, the moments where the builder steered the squad in a new direction.

### What to capture

| Entry Type | When | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Steering Moment** | Builder redirects the squad | "Switched from REST to GraphQL after seeing the query complexity" |
| **Key Decision** | Trade-off was made | "Chose SQLite over Postgres — this is a CLI tool, not a service" |
| **Evolution** | Architecture shifted | "Split monolith into 3 modules after hitting circular deps" |
| **Milestone** | Something shipped | "v0.1.0 published to npm — first public release" |
| **Lesson Learned** | Something surprised you | "Vitest runs 10x faster than Jest for this project — switching permanently" |

### Template for new entries

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Title

### What Happened

(What was built, changed, or decided)

### Why

(The reasoning — what alternatives existed, what trade-offs were made)

### Steering Moment

(How the builder directed the work — what prompt, feedback, or redirection shaped the outcome)

### Impact

(What this changes going forward)
```

### Rules

1. **Write for future-you.** Six months from now, this journal explains *why* the code looks the way it does.
2. **Capture the steering, not the typing.** The git log shows what changed. The journal shows *why it changed*.
3. **Be honest about pivots.** The best journals include "we tried X, it didn't work, here's why we switched to Y."
4. **Update after milestones, not after every commit.** Quality over quantity.

*The code shows what was built. The journal shows why.*
